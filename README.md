Here's a meaningful README.md for the code:

Mohit Birthday or Hello Message

A Python script that uses text-to-speech functionality to greet Mohit with a birthday message on a specific date or a hello message on other days.

Features

- Uses pyttsx3 library for text-to-speech functionality
- Checks the current date to determine whether to wish Mohit a happy birthday or say hello
- Adjusts the speech rate for better clarity

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pyttsx3 library (install using pip install pyttsx3)
- time library (built-in)

Usage

1. Save this script as a Python file (e.g., mohit_greeting.py)
2. Run the script using Python (e.g., python mohit_greeting.py)
3. The script will wait for 10 seconds after desktop loads before greeting Mohit

How it works

1. The script checks the current date using time.localtime()
2. If the current date is December 12th, it wishes Mohit a happy birthday using pyttsx3
3. If the current date is not December 12th, it says hello to Mohit using pyttsx3
4. The script adjusts the speech rate for better clarity

Customization

- You can adjust the speech rate by modifying the engine.setProperty("rate", 120) line
- You can change the greeting messages by modifying the engine.say() lines

Note

- Make sure to install the pyttsx3 library before running the script
- The script uses a 10-second delay before greeting Mohit, which can be adjusted or removed as needed
